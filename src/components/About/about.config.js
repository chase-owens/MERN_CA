    question: `Constructional Affection history?`,
    answer: `Constructional Affection was developed in animal shelters where food was always available. The dogs cared more about being pet, scratched, brushed, and played with than eating treats. It may seem obvious affection is reinforcing for dogs, but it was even more apparent in this case. After having personal success using affection as the reinforcer in our training programs, we conducted free group training classes for new pet parents to see if others could replicate the outcomes following the same rules. After some refinement we were able to systematize using affection as a reinforcer to create calm interactions.`,

    title: `Assessment`,
    question: `Who is this for?`,
    answer: `This is for anyone who's dog is excited or hyper when seeking attention from people. This is not for someone who's dog is exhibiting fear or aggression. Constructional Aggression Treatment is the ideal approach under those circumstances. You can begin Constructional Affection when your dog is approaching for affection rather than distancing themselves.`,
